Markov Chain and Naive Bayes are assignments for my AI course from Fall 2019. Markov Chain was an NLP problem where we were trying to find how likely a sentence of 20 tokens is to show up in an author's writing; using conditional independence. We created a model of all the words (forming unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams) from novels/books written by a specific author to find those probabilities. I did the extra credit portion of this assignment too, and added a second model/author and compared the likelihood of the generated sentences showing up in both author's novels. Naive Bayes was a naive bayes assignment where we trained a model to identify either mushroom types or heart condition (normal or abnormal). We trained our models with the UCI datasets for each problem.

The weather assignment is an assignment from my Deep Learning and Neural Networks course. It was an extra credit assignment where we used weather data and image processing to classify how water stressed soybean plants were. In my model, I combined a multilayer neural network and a convolutional neural network because the weather data was numerical inputs (great for MLPs) and we had images of varying water stress (great for CNNs).
